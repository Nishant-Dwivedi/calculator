### My thought about the project

While the css part of this project was quite simple, the javascript part was on the difficult side. I got the initial draft right quite early, where i was able to perform operations without chaining and display a result.

While trying to get the operations to be chainable, i realised that my initial logic of relying on the "result" variable no longer worked. Eventually,  i got it working, and it definitely felt accomplishing.
